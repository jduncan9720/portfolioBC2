# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

I've created a responsive portfolio using mainly Bootstrap for layout, positioning and styling.  The layout was done using the bootstrap grid system of rows and columns. I've incorporated my own css in places I needed to overwrite the default Bootstrap styles.
